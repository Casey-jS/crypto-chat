Server Has
1. Private Key
2. Public Key associated with private key that is known to everyone
3. Server does not need to share public key (can just be read from file)

When client connects to server:
- Client should generate new asymmetric key
- ex. Client 1 generates its own key (K1)
  - Encrypts K1 using public key and sends to the serveer
  - Now server decrypts the key and knows K1 

  Message From C1 - C2
  - c1 Encrypts 
  - server decrypts
  - server encrypts with K2
  - sends to C2

When we send an encrypted message:
- encrypt(indicator_for_text, key, iv);
 - iv: Makes sure when we encrypt same plain text multiple times, it doesn't result in multiple cypher texts
  - Every encrypted message is unique even if the text is the same
  - iv is essentially xor'd with plain text
  - iv does not need to be secret
- send(m, k, iv), iv
- One more parameter to worry about:
